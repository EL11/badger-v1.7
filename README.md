# badger-v1.7
Code for an Arduino-based device that records presence at works and handles data creating an output to be read from a third party software.
The devices works with 0.96' OLED screen, MFRC-522, KWMobile SD card reader, Arduino Uno, Arduino MKRGSM1400, DS3231, a generic buzzer and a touch sensor.
Feel free to contact for further informations or to submit modifications. I am self-taught, so I probaby miss many improvements.
